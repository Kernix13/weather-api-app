# Openweathermap.org

From the freeCodeCamp video Using a [Public API - Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/BYsTrGH6B2s).

This is my first and only jQuery app. I will be refactoring it to be vanilla JavaScript.

## To-Do

I need to somehow get a list of cities so that a user can type in their city and the autofill will populate the input field, orr to have a lage selct list. The select list should be by country, or if only for US, by state.

- get city input field to work
- add CSS for hours, and days
- total redo of the JS to be more functional that its present state
- change `for` loops to `map()`
- How can I do the Wind direction differently? Can I add conditionals in a Switch statement?
- Why do I have 2 Wind direction blocks?
- Convert from jQuery to Vanialla JavaScript.


## Favicon

There are 2 favicons is in the images folder with a link to one of them in `index.html`. Go to [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/) and do a search for _weather_ if you prefer a different image.
